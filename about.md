<blockquote><span class="bqstart">"</span>I'd imagine the whole world was one big machine. Machines never come with any extra parts, you know. They always come with the exact amount they need. So I figured, if the entire world was one big machine, I couldn't be an extra part. I had to be here for some reason. - Hugo Carbret<span class="bqend">"</span></blockquote>
<h3>Me and Robotics,</h3>
<p>I guess it has to do with Godâ€™s plan for me. My interest in robotics grew when I was at NIT Trichy. I stumbled upon rare knowledge related to robotics in NITT LAN, and was soon determined to learn and engineer robotics system no matter what obstacle I face! What I love in robotics is that this field is truly a child of modern engineering that requires interplay of knowledge from the best of all fields.</p>
<h3>Myself,</h3>
<p>I was born in a small hospital in Nagercoil which is a city in South Tamil Nadu, India. I am the eldest of the two sons in my small family. My younger brother Jerryes Pious Wisely is studying medicine in Christian Medical College Vellore. I am grateful to my mom who is the reason for making me what I am today (I will miss her always!!). My dad has always been the backbone of our family, supporting us in all our endeavors.</p>
<p>My alma mater, Indian School Muscat, Oman is where I was inspired and motivated to pursue a career in engineering. I pursued B.tech in ECE at <a href="www.nitt.edu">National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli</a> (formerly called  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Technology,_Tiruchirappalli">Regional Engineering College Trichy</a>). Currently I am doing  Masters in Robotics Engineering at <a href="www.wpi.edu">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a>.</p>

<p>I like travelling and also enjoy the different perspectives of research one can gain from the different research labs around the world! So far I have worked at National University of Singapore, University of Stuttgart, and WPI.</p>
